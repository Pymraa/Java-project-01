Lab Task 01 – Java Basics Practice
Objective:
This lab introduces students to Java syntax, input/output, variables, data types, operators, and control 
structures using small real-life problems.
Q1: Student Grade Calculator
Topics Covered:
Output, Comments, Variables, Data Types, Operators, Type Casting, If-Else Statements
Instructions:
• Ask the user to enter marks for Quiz (out of 15), Assignment (out of 10), Mid-Term (out of 25), and 
Final Exam (out of 50).
• Store these values in variables of appropriate data types.
• Calculate Total Marks and Average (use type casting to show decimal values).
• Display the Grade using if-else.
• Add comments to explain your code.
Grading Rules:
• Average >= 85 → Grade A
• 70 <= Average < 85 → Grade B
• 50 <= Average < 70 → Grade C
• Average < 50 → Fail
Expected Output Example:
Enter Quiz Marks: 12
Enter Assignment Marks: 9
Enter Mid-Term Marks: 20
Enter Final Marks: 40
Total Marks = 81
Average = 81.0
Grade = B
Q2: Pizza Billing System
Topics Covered:
Strings, If-Else, Switch, Math Operators, Booleans, Output and Comments
Instructions:
• Ask the user for Pizza Size (small, medium, large).
• Use a switch statement to assign base prices: Small = 100, Medium = 200, Large = 300.
• Ask if the user wants pepperoni: Small → +30, Medium/Large → +50.
• Ask if the user wants extra cheese (+20).
• Display the final bill.
Expected Output Example:
Enter pizza size (small/medium/large): small
Do you want pepperoni? (yes/no): yes
Do you want extra cheese? (yes/no): no
Your final bill is: 130 rupee
